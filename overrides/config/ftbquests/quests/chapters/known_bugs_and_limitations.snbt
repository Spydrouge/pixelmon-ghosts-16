				"Known bugs created by Pixelmon are as follows:"
				""
				"1. Broken JEI integration. The button to move ingredients for a recipe into a crafting grid says \"JEI not installed on server\" even in singleplayer. To get around this, use JEI to plan out recipes, and the Vanilla Recipe Book to actually move them into the crafting grid."
				""
				"2. Broken MouseTweaks Integration. MouseTweaks will only work in non-Pixemon interfaces. This means it will work in crafting grids and chests, but not in your inventory, because Pixelmon changes the vanilla inventory GUI. This is very irritating and adds inconsistency to the game, but the alternative is to cut it from the pack and not have it available at all."
				""
				"3. Lava/Water Stone tool abilities don't work. A workaround has been introduced using Crafttweaker scripts, and is introduced during the nether quest line."
				""
				"4. Rock Smash doesn't actually drop the block, and definitely doesn't drop it as if it were mined with Fortune. It deletes the block instead. Only use on unimportant blocks."
